## Tasks for add-streamlit-demo

### Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Create `aiot_hw3/streamlit_app.py` that loads model and shows prediction UI
- [ ] 1.2 Add example inputs and README note for running Streamlit locally
- [ ] 1.3 Write a small smoke test that imports the app module and ensures model loads (if artifact present)
- [ ] 1.4 Create PR and request review
